# Extended-Kalman-Filter-UsingPyTorchAutoGrad
Uses PyTorch tensors and autograd | The extended Kalman filtering algorithm as a class: mean and covariance are attributes and propagation in time are methods | PyTorch autograd is used to return the jacobians of the state and measurement dynamics | Example.py presents a quick demo.

In the case of linear state and measurement dynamics, the presented code works as the usual Kalman filtering algorithm.
